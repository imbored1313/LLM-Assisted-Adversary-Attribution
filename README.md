## System Overview

This toolchain extracts Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and MITRE ATT&CK Technique IDs (TTPs) from APT reports, maps them to known attacker groups using MITRE STIX data, and generates structured intelligence reports via GPT-based analysis. It supports two analysis modes. Rule-based TTP matching and Roberta model inference, both of which converge into a unified GPT-assisted report generation stage.

## Prerequisites to run

### 1. Extract IOCs from APTnotes PDFs

python extract_pdfs.py


This script extracts text, metadata, and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, domains, IPs, hashes, and emails from PDF files into a folder called `extracted_pdfs`. It saves the extracted data as text files and metadata JSON, and writes all found IOCs to a CSV file called `extracted_iocs.csv` for further analysis.

- Input: Folder containing PDF reports (`aptnotes_pdfs/*.pdf`)  
- Output: `Data/extracted_pdfs/extracted_iocs.csv`

---

### 2. Map IOCs to MITRE ATT&CK Groups

python map_iocs_to_attack.py



This script maps observed IOCs from PDF reports to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and threat groups by cross-referencing CSV and JSON data. It ranks threat groups based on technique matches, outputs detailed CSV reports, and generates mini STIX bundles for each analyzed file.

- Input: `Data/extracted_pdfs/extracted_iocs.csv`  
- Output:
  - `Data/mapped/ranked_groups.csv`
  - `Data/mapped/group_ttps_detail.csv`

---

### 3. Process and Normalize the MITRE Dataset

python enterprise_attack.py


This script parses the local MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise bundle (enterprise-attack.json) and builds the relational mapping between intrusion sets (groups) and techniques/sub-techniques.
The resulting CSV is essential for both the IOC mapping process and Roberta model training.

- Input: `Data/attack_stix/enterprise-attack/enterprise-attack-<version>.json`

- Output: `Data/attack_stix/processed/ti_groups_techniques.csv`

Contains columns: `group_sid, group_id, group_name, technique_id, technique_name, is_subtechnique`

---

### 4. Build the Labeled Dataset for Roberta Model Training

python build_dataset.py

This script consolidates the outputs from the IOC mapping (map_iocs_to_attack.py) and MITRE ATT&CK dataset (enterprise_attack.py) into a labeled dataset suitable for Roberta model fine-tuning and evaluation.
It constructs a multi-label classification dataset that maps threat groups to their observed techniques.

- Input:
`Data/mapped/group_ttps_detail.csv`
`Data/attack_stix/processed/ti_groups_techniques.csv`

- Output:
`Data/processed/dataset.csv` – Text dataset for model training
`Data/processed/labels.txt` – Class label reference file

---

## Usage

```
## 1. Create all the necessary files
Run the following scripts sequentially to extract IOCs, build datasets, and map ATT&CK relationships:


python src\data\extract_pdfs.py
python src\data\build_dataset.py
python src\data\enterprise_attack.py
python Data\map_iocs_to_attack.py

## 2. Run the web application

python app.py
navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
```

## Notes

- Limit input to five TTPs max for optimal GPT performance
- Output folders are automatically created if missing

| Issue                        | Cause                          | Solution                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| PyMuPDF not found           | Missing dependency              | Run `pip install pymupdf`              |
| OPENAI_API_KEY not found    | `.env` file missing             | Add your key to `.env`                 |
| No PDFs found               | Incorrect input folder          | Ensure path to `aptnotes_pdfs/` is correct |
| Empty report output         | Invalid TTP input format        | Use valid MITRE IDs (e.g., `T1059.003`) |
